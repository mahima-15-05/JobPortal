# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages can make requests to different domains. By default, web pages can only make requests to the same domain from which they were loaded. This policy is called the Same-Origin Policy.

# Why CORS is Needed:
Security: To prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to a different site on behalf of the user.
Control: To give website owners control over who can access their resources.
How CORS Works:
When a web page makes a request to a different domain (cross-origin request), the browser sends a CORS request to the server hosting the resource. The server can respond with specific headers that indicate whether the request is allowed.
It also allows requests to include credentials like cookies.
In summary, CORS is a way to securely allow one web page to access resources from a different domain, while giving the server control over which requests are permitted.

# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): This is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. Sometimes, you might want to allow such requests, for example, if your frontend and backend are on different domains.

# code :
const corsOptions = {
    origin: `http://localhost:5173`,
    credentials: true
}
app.use(cors(corsOptions));


corsOptions: This is an object that defines the settings for CORS. In this case, it has two properties:

origin: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resources. Here, it allows requests from http//localhost:5173. However, there is a typo here; it should be http://localhost:5173.
credentials: When set to true, this allows cookies and other credentials to be sent with the requests.
app.use(cors(corsOptions)): This line tells your app to use the CORS settings defined in corsOptions. It means that your app will allow requests from http://localhost:5173 and will accept requests that include credentials (like cookies).

In simple terms, this code snippet is configuring your server to allow requests from a specific frontend running at http://localhost:5173 and to accept requests that include cookies or other credentials.
